**Made by Team:**
1. **Daniel Santoso (2201756506) (me)**
2. Axel Jeremy - 2201756140

**Dataset from:**

BINUS University

**Description:**

User Behaviour Clustering is my exam project for the Artificial Neural Network course in my Semester 4 of Computer Science Major at BINUS University. This is a program that can cluster the customers according to their behaviour. PCA with 3 components are used to do feature engineering. The model used for clustering is Self-Organizing Map and the output is the visualization of the model.

**How to Use:**
1. Open Clustering_DanielAxel.ipynb
2. Run all the codes

**Results:**

Visualization of the model after 5000 epochs:
